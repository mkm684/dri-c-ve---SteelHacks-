dri(c)ve - SteelHacks

dri(c)ve is a product that was created in SteelsHacks hackathon. This hackathon took place at the University of Pittsburgh. My friend and I traveled a ten hour drive from Ottawa to Pittsburgh. While there we created a software package to detect if a person is falling asleep. The idea was inspired from my father's lose of a co-worker who died while driving after falling asleep at the wheel. Falling asleep while driving is responsible for 72,000 crashes and 800 fatalities each year. Some possible applications of this project could be to help keep drivers, pilots and heavy equipment operators alert, helpidentify if someone is having a stroke.
